globs: **/*.md
---
## Command Execution
- **Type**: Shell command
- **Command**: `python update_dictionary.py`
- **Working Directory**: Workspace root
- **Post-Action**: Runs assistant with prompt to provide definitions for terms marked `[NEEDS DEFINITION]`

## Process Details
1. Read the current `_content/dictionary.md` file to identify existing abbreviations
2. Scan markdown (.md) files in Articles/, Notes/, and other relevant directories
3. Identify potential abbreviations (all-caps terms, technical terminology)
4. Compare against existing dictionary entries
5. Add new abbreviations to dictionary in alphabetical order with explanations
6. For EACH identified abbreviation in the source files, replace ALL instances with its linked form
7. Use the format `[[_content/dictionary#X|TERM]]` where X is the first letter of the term
8. Ensure the linking is done for both new and existing abbreviations
9. Handle special cases where a term appears mid-sentence or with different capitalization
10. Avoid modifying terms already properly linked to the dictionary
11. After script execution, the assistant will automatically provide detailed definitions for terms marked as `[NEEDS DEFINITION]`

## Environment
- **OS**: Windows
- **Shell**: PowerShell
- **Path**: C:\Users\bjofr\OneDrive - IST\Dokument\Obsidian Vault\it_sikkerhed
- **Dictionary Path**: `_content/dictionary.md`

## Limitations
- Some PowerShell commands may have output formatting issues
- Directory traversal should be done using list_dir tool instead of PowerShell find/grep
- Process large files in sections to avoid memory issues
- Be careful not to create duplicate links when terms already have proper dictionary links
