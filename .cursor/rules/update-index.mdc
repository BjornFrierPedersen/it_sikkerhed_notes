# Update Project Index Rule
Description: Update the project index whenever new files have been added to the vault

## When This Rule Applies
- **Path Pattern**: `**/*.md`
- **Match Pattern**: When a user writes "update the index" or "update project index"

## Instructions

**IMPORTANT**: When this rule is triggered, you MUST start your response by stating: "I'm updating the project index to reflect the current state of the vault." This acknowledgment is required before proceeding with any research or response.

When a user requests to update the index, follow these steps:

1. First check the current project structure using list_dir on key directories
2. Compare the found structure with what's currently in _content/project_index.md
3. Identify any new files, directories, or content areas that should be included
4. Update the project_index.md file to reflect the current state of the vault
5. Provide a summary of the changes made to the index

## Process

- Explore the project structure using list_dir to catalog all content areas
  - Start with the root directory
  - Examine key directories: Notes, Articles, OWASP Cheatsheets, _content
  - Check for any new directories or patterns of content
- Read the current project_index.md file
- Identify differences between the actual project structure and the index
- Update the index to include:
  - New content areas
  - New directories or files that represent important topics
  - Updated statistics (if applicable)
  - Any structural changes
- Maintain the existing organization and formatting of the index
- Provide a concise summary of what was added or changed in the index

## Example

**Query**: "update the index"

**Expected Response**:  
"I'm updating the project index to reflect the current state of the vault." Followed by a summary of how the index was updated, what new content areas were added, and confirmation of successful update.
