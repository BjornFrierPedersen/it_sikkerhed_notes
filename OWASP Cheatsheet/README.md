# OWASP Cheat Sheet Series

## Overview

The OWASP Cheat Sheet Series is a comprehensive collection of high-value information security knowledge focused on specific security topics. These cheat sheets are created and maintained by security experts, providing developers and security professionals with practical guidance to implement strong security controls.

## Purpose

The primary goals of this project are to:

1. **Provide Security Guidance**: Offer concise, actionable advice for implementing security best practices.
2. **Reduce Vulnerabilities**: Help developers avoid common security pitfalls and vulnerabilities.
3. **Promote Security Awareness**: Raise awareness about security concerns in various technologies and frameworks.
4. **Share Expert Knowledge**: Distill the knowledge of security experts into digestible, practical formats.

## Project Structure

The OWASP Cheat Sheet Series is structured as follows:
