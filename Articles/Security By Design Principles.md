Security Principles
	1. Minimize Attack Surface Area: Reduce the overall risk by limiting the features that can be exploited.
	2. Establish Secure Defaults: Ensure that the default configuration is secure.
	3. Principle of Least Privilege: Grant the minimum permissions necessary for users to perform their tasks.
	4. Principle of Defense in Depth ([[_content/dictionary#D|DiD]]): Use multiple layers of security controls to protect against threats.
	5. Fail Securely: Ensure that the system remains secure even when it fails.
	6. Don't Trust Services: Treat external systems as untrusted and validate their data.
	7. Separation of Duties: Divide responsibilities to prevent fraud and errors.
	8. Avoid Security by Obscurity: Do not rely solely on keeping details hidden for security.
	9. Keep Security Simple: Use straightforward and simple security measures.
	10. Fix Security Issues Correctly: Address the root cause of security issues and test the fixes thoroughly.

Core Pillars of Information Security
	• Confidentiality: Only allow access to authorized users.
	• Integrity: Ensure data is not tampered with.
	• Availability: Ensure systems and data are accessible to authorized users when needed.

Security Architecture
	• Importance: Security architecture is crucial for building robust applications.
Considerations: Think about potential abuse of features and ensure processes are secure.
