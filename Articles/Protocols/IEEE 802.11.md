## <span style="color:rgb(57, 224, 140);">Overview</span>
- [[_content/dictionary#I|IEEE]] 802.11 is a set of standards for wireless local area network ([[_content/dictionary#W|WLAN]]) communication.
- It specifies the protocols for medium access control ([[_content/dictionary#M|MAC]]) and physical layer ([[_content/dictionary#P|PHY]]) for wireless networking.

## <span style="color:rgb(57, 224, 140);">Generations</span>
- The standards have evolved over time, starting with 802.11 in 1997.
- Subsequent generations include 802.11b, 802.11a, 802.11g, 802.11n (Wi-Fi 4), 802.11ac (Wi-Fi 5), 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6), and upcoming 802.11be (Wi-Fi 7).

## <span style="color:rgb(57, 224, 140);">Frequencies and Channels</span>
- Uses various frequency bands including 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, 6 GHz, and 60 GHz.
- Channel availability and regulations vary by country.

## <span style="color:rgb(57, 224, 140);">Key Features</span>
- [[_content/dictionary#C|CSMA]]/[[_content/dictionary#C|CA]]: Carrier-sense multiple access with collision avoidance.
- [[_content/dictionary#M|MIMO]]: Multiple-input multiple-output antennas for improved performance.
- [[_content/dictionary#O|OFDMA]]: Orthogonal frequency-division multiple access for better efficiency in dense environments.

## <span style="color:rgb(57, 224, 140);">Security</span>
- Evolved from [[_content/dictionary#W|WEP]] to more secure protocols like [[_content/dictionary#W|WPA]], WPA2, and WPA3.
- Includes mechanisms for encryption and authentication to protect data.
