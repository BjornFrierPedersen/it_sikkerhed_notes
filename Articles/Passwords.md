## Main Argument
Password expiration is an outdated security practice that should be eliminated.

## Reasons for Elimination
- Wrong Threat Model: The original threat model is outdated; modern threats involve password harvesting rather than cracking.
- Behavioral Cost: Frequent password changes impose significant behavioral costs on employees and negatively impact organizational culture.
- Minimal Risk Mitigation: Password expiration creates an illusion of security without effectively mitigating risks.

## Alternative Solutions
- Passphrases and password managers are recommended for simplifying the process while managing risks.
- Multifactor Authentication ([[_content/dictionary#M|MFA]]) should be used for high-risk accounts.

## Current Trends
- The [[_content/dictionary#U|UK]] government's [[_content/dictionary#N|NCSC]] and [[_content/dictionary#N|NIST]] have published guidelines recommending the elimination of password expiration.
