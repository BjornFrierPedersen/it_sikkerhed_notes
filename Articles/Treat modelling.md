## Introduction
- Purpose: Structured approach to identify, quantify, and address security risks in applications.
- Perspective: Looks at systems from an attacker's viewpoint.

## Steps in Threat Modeling

### Scope Your Work:

- Draw diagrams (e.g., Data Flow Diagrams).
- Identify entry points, assets, and trust levels.

### Determine Threats:

- Use methodologies like [[_content/dictionary#S|STRIDE]].
- Identify threats using threat trees and common threat lists.

### Determine Countermeasures and Mitigation:

- Map threats to countermeasures.
- Prioritize based on factors like likelihood and impact.

### Assess Your Work:

- Ensure documentation of diagrams, threat lists, and control lists.

## Additional Information

- Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs): Visual representation of data movement and trust boundaries.
- Trust Levels: Define access rights for external entities.
- Example Diagrams and Threat Lists: Provide practical illustrations and common threats.

This page emphasizes the importance of integrating threat modeling into the Software Development Life Cycle ([[_content/dictionary#S|SDLC]]) to enhance application security.
