# [[_content/dictionary#C|CIS]] Critical Security Controls

## Overview

The [[_content/dictionary#C|CIS]] Critical Security Controls速 (CIS Controls速) started as a grassroots activity to identify the most common and important real-world cyber attacks that affect enterprises every day. The goal was to translate that knowledge into positive, constructive actions for defenders, and share that information with a wider audience.

Led by the Center for Internet Security速 ([[_content/dictionary#C|CIS]]速), the CIS Controls have evolved into an international community of volunteer individuals and institutions that:

- Share insights into attacks and attackers, identify root causes, and translate that into classes of defensive action
- Create and share tools, working aids, and stories of adoption and problem-solving
- Map the [[_content/dictionary#C|CIS]] Controls to regulatory and compliance frameworks
- Identify and solve common problems and barriers as a community

## Structure of [[_content/dictionary#C|CIS]] Controls

The [[_content/dictionary#C|CIS]] Controls are organized into a structure that includes:

- **Controls**: 18 high-level categories of cybersecurity actions
- **Safeguards**: Specific actions within each Control to improve security posture
