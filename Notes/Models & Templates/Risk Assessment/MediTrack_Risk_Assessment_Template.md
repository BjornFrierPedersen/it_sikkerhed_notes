## Risk Assessment Section

| Risk - What might affect confidentiality, availability or integrity | Risk owner | Why is this a threat/risk? | Estimate Consequence (1-5) | Estimate Probability (1-5) | Why is the probability of this assessed? | Calculated risk (CÃ—P) | Accepted (Yes/No/Avoid) |
|------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| **CONFIDENTIALITY RISKS** |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Unauthorized access to patient health information | CISO | Patient data is subject to privacy regulations; breaches can result in regulatory penalties, reputation damage, and legal liability | 5 | 3 | Despite access controls, the growing attack surface with mobile access and third-party integrations increases risk. Historical data shows healthcare is a prime target for attacks. | 15 | Avoid |
| Improper handling of PHI data in test environments | CTO | Test environments occasionally use copies of production data with PHI, creating risk of unauthorized access or exposure | 4 | 4 | Current practices allow developers to use production data copies for testing without complete anonymization. Limited controls are in place for test environment access. | 16 | Avoid |
| Data exposure through third-party integrations | Integration Manager | Healthcare facility integrations with varying security standards could lead to data leakage or unauthorized access | 5 | 3 | Custom connectors have different security levels; third-party security practices are not consistently audited or validated | 15 | Avoid |
| **INTEGRITY RISKS** |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Corruption of medication dosage data | Product Manager | Incorrect medication dosages could lead to patient harm, liability, and reputation damage | 5 | 2 | Multiple validation checks exist, but software updates or database errors could still impact data integrity | 10 | Avoid |
| Unauthorized modification of inventory records | Operations Manager | Manipulation of inventory data could lead to medication shortages, financial losses, or controlled substance diversion | 4 | 2 | Access controls and audit trails exist, but increasing system complexity and user base expands potential attack vectors | 8 | No |
| Software update errors affecting data integrity | Development Manager | Bugs or errors in biweekly updates could corrupt critical patient or medication data | 4 | 3 | Regular update cycles with fast development timelines increase risk despite QA processes | 12 | Avoid |
| **AVAILABILITY RISKS** |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| System outage affecting real-time medication tracking | Operations Manager | Healthcare facilities rely on real-time medication tracking; outages could disrupt patient care and create safety risks | 5 | 2 | Redundancy exists but system complexity and third-party dependencies create residual risk | 10 | Avoid |
| Database performance issues during peak usage | CTO | Slow performance during high-demand periods could delay medication administration or create data recording gaps | 3 | 3 | Current architecture handles typical load but may struggle during peak times across multiple facilities | 9 | Yes |
| Loss of connectivity with client hospital systems | Integration Manager | Connectivity issues could prevent data synchronization between MediTrack and client EHR systems | 4 | 3 | Multiple integration points with various client technologies create numerous potential failure points | 12 | Avoid |
| **COMPLIANCE RISKS** |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Failure to meet healthcare data protection regulations | Compliance Officer | Non-compliance with healthcare privacy laws could result in significant fines, sanctions, and reputation damage | 5 | 2 | Regular compliance reviews are performed, but regulations are complex and evolving | 10 | Avoid |
| Inadequate audit trails for regulatory reporting | CISO | Insufficient activity logging could hamper investigations and fail to meet compliance requirements | 4 | 2 | Current logging is comprehensive but not regularly reviewed for completeness or gaps | 8 | No |
| Non-compliance with client security requirements | Compliance Officer | Clients may have stricter security requirements than MediTrack's baseline, leading to contract breaches | 3 | 3 | Client security requirements vary widely and are not systematically tracked across all clients | 9 | Yes |
