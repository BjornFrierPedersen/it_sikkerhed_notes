# Security Framework Selection Guide

## Simplified Explanation

Think of security frameworks like different types of tools in a toolbox. Just as you wouldn't use a hammer for every home repair job, you shouldn't use the same security framework for every security need. This guide helps you pick the right tool for the right job.

## Quick Reference Table

| If You Need To... | Use This Framework | Why? |
|------------------|-------------------|------|
| Set up an overall security program | NIST CSF | Provides comprehensive guidance and is widely recognized |
| Implement specific security controls | SCF | Detailed, practical controls that map to multiple standards |
| Build secure software | OWASP ASVS | Specific to application security verification |
| Model potential threats | Threat Modeling | Identifies specific risks to your system |
| Assess overall risk | Risk Assessment | Evaluates impact and likelihood of threats |
| Manage security maturity | OWASP SAMM | Focuses on software security maturity |

## When to Use Each Framework

### NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)
**Best for:**
- Starting a new security program
- Government compliance requirements
- Creating a comprehensive security strategy
- Evaluating overall security posture

**Not ideal for:**
- Detailed technical implementations
- Specific coding guidelines
- Quick security assessments

### Secure Controls Framework (SCF)
**Best for:**
- Implementing specific security controls
- Meeting multiple compliance requirements
- Day-to-day security operations
- Detailed security checklists

**Not ideal for:**
- High-level strategy
- Threat analysis
- Software development specifics

### OWASP ASVS (Application Security Verification Standard)
**Best for:**
- Verifying application security
- Security testing requirements
- Secure coding guidelines
- Application security assessments

**Not ideal for:**
- Physical security
- Overall security strategy
- Business risk assessment

### Threat Modeling
**Best for:**
- Understanding specific system risks
- Design phase security
- Identifying attack vectors
- Security architecture decisions

**Not ideal for:**
- Compliance requirements
- Operational procedures
- General security controls

### Risk Assessment
**Best for:**
- Evaluating business impact
- Prioritizing security investments
- Understanding risk landscape
- Cost-benefit analysis

**Not ideal for:**
- Technical implementation details
- Specific security controls
- Day-to-day operations

### OWASP SAMM (Software Assurance Maturity Model)
**Best for:**
- Software development lifecycle
- Security program maturity
- Development team practices
- Security improvement roadmap

**Not ideal for:**
- Network security
- Physical security
- Compliance requirements

## How These Frameworks Work Together

1. **Strategic Level**
   - Start with NIST CSF for overall direction
   - Use Risk Assessment to prioritize efforts
   - Apply SAMM for software development maturity

2. **Tactical Level**
   - Implement SCF controls based on NIST guidance
   - Use Threat Modeling to identify specific risks
   - Apply ASVS for application security requirements

3. **Operational Level**
   - Follow SCF controls for daily operations
   - Use ASVS checklists for application testing
   - Apply specific controls based on threat models

## Common Framework Combinations

### For Enterprise Security Programs
1. NIST CSF → Overall strategy
2. SCF → Specific controls
3. Risk Assessment → Prioritization

### For Application Security
1. OWASP SAMM → Program maturity
2. OWASP ASVS → Security requirements
3. Threat Modeling → Design security

### For Compliance-Focused Organizations
1. NIST CSF → Framework alignment
2. SCF → Control implementation
3. Risk Assessment → Gap analysis

## Tips for Framework Selection

1. **Start with Your Goals**
   - Compliance requirements?
   - Security maturity targets?
   - Specific security needs?

2. **Consider Your Resources**
   - Available expertise
   - Time constraints
   - Budget limitations

3. **Evaluate Your Context**
   - Industry requirements
   - Organization size
   - Threat landscape

4. **Plan for Integration**
   - How frameworks will complement each other
   - Avoid duplicate efforts
   - Leverage existing work

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Framework Overload**
   - Don't try to implement everything at once
   - Focus on what provides the most value
   - Start small and expand

2. **Rigid Application**
   - Frameworks are guides, not rules
   - Adapt to your needs
   - Focus on outcomes

3. **Ignoring Context**
   - Consider your industry
   - Account for organization size
   - Adapt to your threat landscape
