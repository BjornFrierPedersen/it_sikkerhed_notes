## Common Risk Management Process: 
1. Identification of assets, threats, and vulnerabilities
2. Assesment of risks
3. Prioritize
4. Treatment
## ACAT
- Avoid: Stop or avoid doing the risky thing
- Control: Use special procedures and or safeguards to control the risks
- Accept: If it costs more to treat the risk than you get out of it, you can accept it
- Transfe: You con outsource the risk management to another company that specializes in this

## Analysis paralysis
Sometimes the organisation can become so focused on risk management and mitigation, that it stops the work process completely, since everything has to be up to code and follow a million standards before development can begin.

Keeo it simple and easy to explain to stakeholders. [[_content/dictionary#I|IT]] risks needs to be handled, but it should still allow for features and user availability.

## Risk appetite
- Minimal risk appetite: ultra safe options
- Open: balances risk with reward
