Concept Overview
	• Definition: Defense in depth ([[_content/dictionary#D|DiD]]) is a security strategy involving multiple layers of security controls to protect [[_content/dictionary#I|IT]] systems.
	• Origin: Inspired by a military strategy, but adapted for information security by the [[_content/dictionary#N|NSA]].

Key Principles
	• Layering: Use several independent methods to defend against attacks.
	• Redundancy: Ensure that if one security control fails, others will continue to provide protection.
	• Comprehensive Protection: Protect information throughout its entire lifecycle, from creation to disposal.

Types of Controls
	• Physical Controls: Measures like fences, guards, and [[_content/dictionary#C|CCTV]] systems to physically limit access.
	• Technical Controls: Hardware or software solutions like disk encryption, authentication, and antivirus software.
	• Administrative Controls: Policies and procedures to ensure proper security guidance and compliance.

Implementation Methods
	• System and Application: Use antivirus software, encryption, multi-factor authentication, and intrusion detection systems.
	• Network: Implement firewalls, [[_content/dictionary#V|VPN]]s, and demilitarized zones ([[_content/dictionary#D|DMZ]]s).
	• Physical Security: Employ biometrics, data-centric security, and physical security measures like deadbolt locks.
