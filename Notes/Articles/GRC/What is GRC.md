## What is GRC?
**GRC stands for Governance, Risk, and Compliance.**
*It involves processes and procedures that help organizations achieve business goals, manage uncertainties, and act with integrity.*

## What drives the need for GRC?
- Increased regulatory requirements: More complex rules.
- Digitalization of risk management: New technologies increase vulnerabilities.
- Risk as part of business strategy: Risk management is seen as a strategic function.
- Advanced analytics: Better insights for data-driven decisions.

## Components of GRC
- Governance: Aligning processes with business goals.
- Risk: Identifying and managing risks.
- Compliance: Ensuring adherence to legal requirements.
- Benefits of integrated GRC software
- Automation: Reduces manual tasks.
- Efficiency: Improves collaboration and insights.
- Security: Protects data with high security.
- Accessibility: Access from any device, anytime.

### Implementing GRC software
- Define goals: Clear business requirements and success criteria.
- Communication: Be open and clear in communication.
- Test thoroughly: Ensure comprehensive user testing.

| Maturity Level | Description | Key Attributes |
|---------------|-------------|----------------|
| One | Ad hoc | The management of risk is undocumented, in flux, and depends on individual heroics. |
| Two | Preliminary | Risk is defined in different ways and managed in silos. Process discipline is unlikely to be rigorous. |
| Three | Defined | A common risk assessment/response framework is in place. An organization-wide view of risk is provided to executive leadership and the board in the form of a list of 'top' risks. Action plans are implemented in response to high-priority risks. |
| Four | Integrated | GRC activities are coordinated across business areas. Common risk management tools and processes are used where appropriate, with enterprise-wide risk monitoring, measurement, and reporting. Alternative responses are analyzed with scenario planning and other techniques, such as Monte Carlo simulation. Process metrics are in place. But the emphasis remains on managing a list of risks. Discussion of risk at executive committee and board levels is separate from the discussion of strategy and performance. |
| Five | Optimized | The focus shifts from managing a list of risks outside the context of enterprise objectives to managing for the successful achievement of objectives. The consideration of what might happen is embedded in strategic planning, capital allocation, and other processes, as well as in daily strategic and tactical decision-making. There is a reasonable level of assurance that decision-makers are taking the right level of the right risks necessary for success and not just to avoid failure. Early-warning systems exist to notify board and management both of specific risks above established risk appetite or risk-capacity thresholds â€“ and where the likelihood of achieving enterprise objectives is less than acceptable. Reporting to management and the board integrates performance reporting (where we are now) and risk (what might happen) to project the likelihood of achieving each enterprise objective. Discussion of risk at top management and board levels (what might happen) is not separate from the discussion of strategy and performance. |
