## TL;DR - Simple Explanation
GRC (Governance, Risk Management & Compliance) is like having brakes on a car:
- Just like brakes let you drive safely at high speeds, GRC lets businesses operate efficiently while staying safe
- It consists of three main parts:
  1. Rules and policies (Governance)
  2. Managing potential problems (Risk Management)
  3. Following laws and regulations (Compliance)

The main goal is to:
- Prevent accidents (security incidents)
- Follow the law
- Protect the company's data and reputation
- Make sure everyone knows what they should be doing

Think of it as a safety system that:
- Sets clear rules (policies)
- Identifies potential dangers (risks)
- Makes sure the company follows laws (compliance)
- Documents everything to prove the company is being responsible

*How fast would you drive your car if you didn't have any brakes? Think about that for a moment - you would likely drive at a crawl in first gear and even then you would invariably have accidents as you bump into objects and other vehicles to slow down. Brakes on a vehicle actually allow you to drive fast, in addition to safely navigating dangers on the road!*

*While it is not the most flattering analogy, GRC is akin to the brakes on your car, where they enable a business' operations to go fast and avoid catastrophic accidents. Without those "brakes", an accident is a certainty! These brakes that enable a business' operations to stay within the guardrails are its cybersecurity policies, standards and procedures. These requirements constitute "reasonable practices" that the organization is required to implement and maintain to avoid being negligent.*

## Governance, Risk Management & Compliance (GRC) and Integrated Risk Management (IRM)
- Essence: GRC and IRM are used synonymously and are essential for avoiding negligence and improving IT, cybersecurity, and privacy effectiveness.
- Investment: GRC helps avoid negligence and improves operational efficiency in IT, cybersecurity, and privacy.

## Integrated Controls Management (ICM)
- Model: ICM focuses on controls as the central point for cybersecurity and privacy operations.
- Definition: ICM is a holistic, technology-agnostic approach to cybersecurity and data protection controls, covering people, processes, technology, and data.

## PDCA Process
- Plan, Do, Check & Act (PDCA): A continuous process to evaluate risks, threats, and performance trends.
- Phases:
    - Plan: Define policies, standards, and controls.
    - Do: Implement controls and procedures.
    - Check: Achieve situational awareness through reporting and auditing.
    - Act: Manage risks and adjust processes.

## Minimum Compliance Requirements (MCR) vs. Discretionary Security Requirements (DSR)
- MCR: Absolute minimum requirements based on laws, regulations, and contracts.
- DSR: Additional controls based on the organization's risk tolerance.

## Importance of Documentation
- Due Diligence and Due Care: Documentation shows that the organization has taken reasonable steps to avoid negligence.
- Logical Order of GRC: Compliance influences Governance, which influences Risk Management.

## Principles of ICM
- Establish Context: Identify external and internal requirements.
- Define Controls: Tailored control sets with MCR and DSR.
- Assign Maturity Criteria: Define targets for people, processes, and technology.
- Publish Documentation: Formalize requirements via policies and standards.
- Assign Accountability: Ensure controls have ownership for accountability.
- Maintain Situational Awareness: Long-term trend analysis and risk management.
- Manage Risk: Proactive risk management throughout the lifecycle.
- Evolve Processes: Adapt and develop cybersecurity measures.

## Logical Order of GRC Functions
- Compliance: Identify legal and contractual obligations.
- Governance: Develop policies and standards based on compliance.
- Risk Management: Assess and manage risks based on governance.

## Role of Documentation
- Good: Evidence of due diligence and due care.
- Bad: Lack of documentation can lead to negligence.
- Garbage In = Garbage Out (GIGO)
- Automation: GRC tools should automate existing processes, not dictate them.

## GRC as a Puzzle
- Solution: GRC helps avoid negligence and ensures reasonable security and privacy practices.
