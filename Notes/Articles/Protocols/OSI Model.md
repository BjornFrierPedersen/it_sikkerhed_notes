## Overview
- The Open Systems Interconnection ([[_content/dictionary#O|OSI]]) model is a reference model developed by the International Organization for Standardization ([[_content/dictionary#I|ISO]]) to standardize networking protocols and promote interoperability.
- It consists of seven abstraction layers: Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application.

## History
- Developed in the late 1970s and published in 1984.
- Aimed to support diverse computer networking methods and provide a comprehensive description of networking.

## Layer Architecture
- Physical Layer: Transmission and reception of raw data.
- Data Link Layer: Node-to-node data transfer and error detection.
- Network Layer: Routing and forwarding of packets.
- Transport Layer: Reliable data transfer and flow control.
- Session Layer: Managing communication sessions.
- Presentation Layer: Data translation and encryption.
- Application Layer: High-level protocols for resource sharing and remote file access.

## Comparison to Other Networking Suites
- Compared with the [[_content/dictionary#T|[[_content/dictionary#T|TCP]]/[[_content/dictionary#I|IP]]]] model, which is less rigorous but more widely used.
- [[_content/dictionary#O|OSI]] model is still used for teaching and documentation, despite the popularity of the Internet protocol suite.

## Cross-Layer Functions
- Services like security and management that affect multiple layers.
- Examples include Multiprotocol Label Switching ([[_content/dictionary#M|MPLS]]) and cross-layer optimization in wireless networks.
