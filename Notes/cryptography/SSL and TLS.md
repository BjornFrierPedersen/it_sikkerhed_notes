# [[_content/dictionary#S|SSL]] and [[_content/dictionary#T|TLS]]

## Explained in Simple Terms
[[_content/dictionary#S|SSL]] (Secure Sockets Layer) and its successor [[_content/dictionary#T|TLS]] (Transport Layer Security) are protocols that provide secure communication over the internet. They're like an armored mail truck for your data â€” they ensure that when you send information online, it's encrypted so no one can read it except the intended recipient, verified so you know you're communicating with the right website, and protected from tampering so no one can alter the contents during transit. When you see "https://" or a padlock icon in your browser, that means [[_content/dictionary#S|SSL]]/[[_content/dictionary#T|TLS]] is protecting your connection.

## How [[_content/dictionary#T|TLS]] Works

### TLS Handshake Process
1. **Client Hello**: Client sends supported [[_content/dictionary#T|TLS]] versions, cipher suites, and a random value
2. **Server Hello**: Server chooses [[_content/dictionary#T|TLS]] version and cipher suite, sends its certificate and a random value
3. **Certificate Validation**: Client verifies the server's certificate against trusted [[_content/dictionary#C|CA]]s
4. **Key Exchange**: Client and server establish a shared secret using asymmetric cryptography
5. **Session Key Generation**: Both parties derive symmetric session keys from the shared secret
6. **Finished Messages**: Both sides confirm the handshake completed successfully

### Key [[_content/dictionary#T|TLS]] Components

#### Cipher Suites
- Combinations of algorithms for key exchange, authentication, encryption, and message integrity
- Example: `TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384` ([[_content/dictionary#T|TLS]] 1.3 suite using [[_content/dictionary#A|AES]]-256 in [[_content/dictionary#G|GCM]] mode with [[_content/dictionary#S|SHA]]-384)
- Older [[_content/dictionary#T|TLS]] versions used more complex naming: `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384`

#### Digital Certificates
- [[_content/dictionary#X|X.509]] certificates containing:
  - Server's public key
  - Server identity (domain name)
  - Issuing Certificate Authority information
  - Validity period
  - Digital signature from the issuing [[_content/dictionary#C|CA]]

#### Session Keys
- Symmetric encryption keys used for bulk data encryption
- Generated uniquely for each connection
- Discarded after the session ends (forward secrecy in modern implementations)

## [[_content/dictionary#T|TLS]] Security Features

### Confidentiality
- Encryption of all data transmitted between client and server
- Modern ciphers: [[_content/dictionary#A|AES]]-[[_content/dictionary#G|GCM]], [[_content/dictionary#C|ChaCha20]]-[[_content/dictionary#P|Poly1305]]
- Perfect Forward Secrecy in [[_content/dictionary#T|TLS]] 1.2 (with proper configurations) and [[_content/dictionary#T|TLS]] 1.3

### Integrity
- Message Authentication Codes (MACs) detect any tampering with transmitted data
- Modern algorithms: [[_content/dictionary#H|HMAC]]-SHA256, HMAC-SHA384, [[_content/dictionary#P|Poly1305]]

### Authentication
- Server authentication using [[_content/dictionary#X|X.509]] certificates
- Optional client authentication (mutual [[_content/dictionary#T|TLS]])
- Certificate chain validation through trusted Certificate Authorities

### Replay Protection
- Sequence numbers prevent replay attacks
- Each record contains a unique sequence number
- Prevents attackers from capturing and retransmitting previous messages
