# Cryptography

## Explained in Simple Terms
Cryptography is the practice of securing communication by transforming readable information (plaintext) into unintelligible gibberish (ciphertext) that can only be decoded back to plaintext by someone with the right key or password. Think of it like a special lock box - you put your message in, lock it with a key, and only someone with the matching key can open it and read the message.
