# Problems Cryptography Solves

## Explained in Simple Terms
Cryptography solves four main problems in the digital world: keeping secrets private (confidentiality), ensuring information hasn't been changed (integrity), verifying who sent something (authentication), and preventing people from denying they sent something (non-repudiation). It's like having a lockbox that only certain people can open, a tamper-evident seal that shows if something was changed, a fingerprint that proves who handled it, and a signature that can't be denied.

## Core Security Problems Addressed

### 1. Confidentiality
- **Problem**: How do we keep sensitive information secret from unauthorized people?
- **Cryptographic Solution**: Encryption transforms data so that only authorized parties with the correct decryption key can access the original information.
- **Examples**: Protecting credit card numbers during online purchases, securing medical records, enabling private communications.

### 2. Integrity
- **Problem**: How do we ensure data hasn't been modified accidentally or maliciously?
- **Cryptographic Solution**: Hashing and digital signatures create mathematical "fingerprints" of data that reveal any changes.
- **Examples**: Verifying software hasn't been tampered with before installation, ensuring financial records haven't been altered.

### 3. Authentication
- **Problem**: How do we verify that someone or something is who they claim to be?
- **Cryptographic Solution**: Digital signatures, certificates, and cryptographic protocols provide reliable ways to verify identities.
- **Examples**: Logging into your bank account, verifying a website is legitimate, confirming email sender identity.

### 4. Non-repudiation
- **Problem**: How do we prevent someone from denying they took an action?
- **Cryptographic Solution**: Digital signatures tied to unique private keys provide undeniable proof of who sent a message.
- **Examples**: Electronic contracts, financial transactions, official communications.

## Additional Problems Solved

### 5. Key Exchange
- **Problem**: How do parties securely share secret keys over insecure channels?
- **Cryptographic Solution**: Key exchange protocols like Diffie-Hellman allow secure key sharing even when communications might be intercepted.

### 6. Forward Secrecy
- **Problem**: How do we ensure past communications remain secure even if keys are later compromised?
- **Cryptographic Solution**: Ephemeral key exchange techniques generate temporary keys for each session.

### 7. Privacy and Anonymity
- **Problem**: How do we protect personal information and activity patterns?
- **Cryptographic Solution**: Zero-knowledge proofs, anonymous credentials, and mixing techniques enable privacy-preserving authentication and transactions.

## Real-World Applications

Cryptography enables these essential services:
- Secure web browsing ([[_content/dictionary#H|HTTPS]])
- Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)
- Secure messaging applications
- Digital currencies and blockchain
- Password storage systems
- Digital rights management
- Secure remote access
- Electronic voting

## Limitations

While cryptography solves many security problems, it's important to note its limitations:
- Even perfect cryptography can be undermined by poor implementation
- Social engineering can bypass cryptographic protections
- The "human factor" remains the weakest link in many systems
- Quantum computing threatens some current cryptographic methods

## Historical Context

Cryptography has evolved from simple substitution ciphers used in ancient times to sophisticated mathematical algorithms used today. The core problems it solves have remained consistent, but the methods have grown dramatically more complex and secure.
