## Overview

Risk management is a structured approach to identifying, assessing, and mitigating potential threats to an organization's critical assets, operations, and objectives. This document provides an overview of risk management concepts, frameworks, and best practices.

## Core Concepts

### Definition of Risk

According to [[_content/dictionary#N|NIST]] [[_content/dictionary#S|SP]] 800-30, risk is defined as:

> "A measure of the extent to which an entity is threatened by a potential circumstance or event, and typically a function of: (i) the adverse impacts that would arise if the circumstance or event occurs; and (ii) the likelihood of occurrence."

At its most basic level, risk represents uncertainty. Any risk comprises several key elements:
- A threat actor or source (may be malicious or unintentional)
- An asset with a vulnerability
- A probability or likelihood of occurrence
- Potential impact (which can be either negative or positive)

Risk management is accomplished by balancing exposure to risks against the cost of mitigation and implementing appropriate countermeasures and controls.

### The Risk Equation

```
Risk = Threat × (Likelihood × Vulnerability) × Impact
```

This equation illustrates that risk can be controlled by addressing any of its components:
- Eliminating the threat
- Reducing the vulnerability
- Minimizing the impact
- Decreasing the likelihood of exploitation

                   │   Risk    │
                   └─────┬─────┘
          ┌─────────────┴──────────────┐
          ▼                            ▼

   │   Threat   │              │   Impact   │
   └────────────┘              └────────────┘
          ▲

┌────────────┐ ┌────────────┐
│ Likelihood │ │Vulnerability│
└────────────┘ └────────────┘
```

## Tiers of Risk Management

According to [[_content/dictionary#N|NIST]] [[_content/dictionary#S|SP]] 800-39, risk management occurs across three organizational tiers:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Tier 1: Organization (Governance)           │
│ Strategic Risk - Long-term planning         │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Tier 2: Mission (Business Process)          │
│ Operational Risk - Business functions       │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Tier 3: Information System                  │
│ Tactical Risk - Day-to-day implementation   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Tier 1: Organization (Governance)

- Addresses risk from an organizational perspective
- Involves developing a comprehensive governance structure
- Creates an organization-wide risk management strategy
- Focuses on strategic risk and long-term planning
- Managed at the highest levels of the organization

### Tier 2: Mission (Business Process)

- Addresses risk from a mission and business process perspective
- Guided by the risk decisions made at Tier 1
- Associated with Enterprise Architecture
- Focuses on business functions that support organizational goals

### Tier 3: Information System (Environment of Operations)

- Influenced by risk decisions made at Tiers 1 and 2
- Focuses on the selection and deployment of security controls
- Addresses tactical risks in the operational environment
- Deals with day-to-day implementation of security measures

It's crucial to manage risk at all three tiers. Ignoring risks at lower levels can lead to accumulated problems that eventually impact mission success and organizational viability.

## Key Risk Management Concepts

### Types of Risk

1. **Inherent Risk**: The risk associated with an activity itself, before any controls are applied
   - Example: Complex regulations or poor management

2. **Control Risk**: The risk that comes from a failure of controls to properly mitigate risk
   - Example: Failure of a firewall to block malicious traffic

3. **Residual Risk**: What remains after controls have been applied
   - Note: Eliminating risk entirely is not possible if you choose to expose yourself to it
   - Residual risk must be formally accepted by management

```
┌─────────────────┐
│  Inherent Risk  │
└────────┬────────┘
         │
         ▼
┌─────────────────┐
│    Controls     │
└────────┬────────┘
         │
         ▼
┌─────────────────┐
│  Residual Risk  │
└─────────────────┘
```

### Response vs. Recovery Timeline

Risk management spans a timeline that includes:

```
┌────────────────┐     ┌────────────────┐     ┌────────────────┐     ┌────────────────┐
│   Planning &   │     │                │     │                │     │                │
│   Prevention   │ ──► │    Response    │ ──► │    Recovery    │ ──► │  Restoration   │
│    (Before)    │     │    (During)    │     │    (After)     │     │                │
└────────────────┘     └────────────────┘     └────────────────┘     └────────────────┘
```

1. **Planning and Prevention (Before)**
   - Business as usual
   - Implementation of physical and cyber security practices
   - Proactive monitoring and risk assessment

2. **Response (During)**
   - Focus on life and limb
   - Incident response activities
   - Blocking attacks and limiting exposure
   - Initial damage assessment

3. **Recovery (After)**
   - Business continuity measures
   - Implementation of mutual support arrangements
   - Operation from alternate sites or with alternate processes

4. **Restoration**
   - Return to primary site or establishment at new permanent site
   - Restoration of normal operations

## Risk Assessment

Risk assessment is a structured study of:
- Vulnerabilities
- Threats
- Likelihood of occurrence
- Potential loss or impact
- Theoretical effectiveness of security measures

The process includes:
1. Identifying critical assets and processes
2. Analyzing vulnerabilities within those assets
3. Identifying potential threats
4. Assessing possible impacts
5. Determining resulting risks
6. Developing appropriate mitigations

```
┌─────────────────────┐
│   Critical Assets   │◄───┐
└──────────┬──────────┘    │
           │               │
           ▼               │
┌─────────────────────┐    │
│   Vulnerabilities   │    │
└──────────┬──────────┘    │
           │               │
           ▼               │

┌─────────────────────┐    │
│     Mitigation      │────┘
└─────────────────────┘
```

## Business Continuity

### Business Continuity Management

Business continuity management aims to:
- Identify potential impacts that threaten a business
- Build resilience and capability for effective response
- Safeguard critical interests (financial, reputation, etc.)

### Business Continuity Planning Process

The process typically includes these phases:

```
┌──────────────┐  ┌──────────────┐  ┌──────────────┐  ┌──────────────┐
│    Project   │  │     Risk     │  │   Business   │  │  Mitigation  │
│  Initiation  │─►│  Assessment  │─►│    Impact    │─►│   Strategy   │
│              │  │              │  │   Analysis   │  │ Development  │
└──────────────┘  └──────────────┘  └──────────────┘  └──────┬───────┘
                                                             │
┌──────────────┐  ┌──────────────┐  ┌──────────────┐        │
│    [[_content/dictionary#B|BC]]/[[_content/dictionary#D|DR]]     │  │   Training,   │  │    [[_content/dictionary#B|BC]]/[[_content/dictionary#D|DR]]     │        │
│     Plan     │◄─│   Testing,    │◄─│     Plan     │◄───────┘
│ Maintenance  │  │   Auditing    │  │ Development  │
└──────────────┘  └──────────────┘  └──────────────┘
```

The basic objectives are to:
- Keep an organization running as normally as possible during emergencies
- Protect critical business operations
- Cover both disaster recovery planning and business resumption planning

## Business Impact Analysis

A comprehensive business impact analysis includes:

1. **Critical Function Assessment**
   - Determining what is important to the organization
   - Identifying critical business functions and assets

2. **Threat Assessment**
   - Understanding what threats exist to critical functions
   - Analyzing threat actors and their motivations

3. **Vulnerability Analysis**
   - Identifying vulnerabilities in systems and processes
   - Assessing the likelihood of vulnerabilities being exploited

4. **Impact Evaluation**
   - Determining the business impact if threats materialize
   - Quantifying potential losses

5. **Risk Analysis**
   - Analyzing risks based on the risk equation
   - Prioritizing risks based on severity

6. **Response Planning**
   - Deciding how to address identified risks
   - Developing mitigation strategies

## Operational Resilience

Resilience is defined as "the physical property of a material when it can return to its original shape or position after deformation that does not exceed its elastic limit."

Operational resilience is "the emergent property of an organization that can continue to carry out its mission in the presence of operational stress and disruption that does not exceed its limit."

### Elements of Resilience

Operational resilience emerges from effective operational risk management and consists of three overlapping areas:

```
          ┌───────────────────┐
          │                   │
          │     Security      │
          │                   │
┌─────────┴───────┬───────────┴─────────┐
│                 │                     │
│                 │                     │
│                 │                     │
│  [[_content/dictionary#I|IT]] Operations  │      Business       │
│                 │     Continuity      │
│                 │                     │
│                 │                     │
└─────────────────┴─────────────────────┘
```

1. **Security** (Information Assurance, Network Security)
2. **Business Continuity** ([[_content/dictionary#C|COOP]], Redundancy, Backups)
3. **[[_content/dictionary#I|IT]] Operations**

All three elements must be addressed; none should be ignored in favor of the others.

### Sources of Operational Risk

Operational risk typically comes from four categories:
1. Actions of people
2. Systems and technology failures
3. Failed internal processes
4. External events

## Risk Management Process

The risk management process consists of iterative steps:

```
           ┌────────────────┐
           │      Risk      │
┌──────────│ Identification │◄─────────┐
│          └───────┬────────┘          │
│                  │                   │
│                  ▼                   │
│          ┌────────────────┐          │
│          │      Risk      │          │
│          │    Analysis    │          │
│          └───────┬────────┘          │
│                  │                   │
│                  ▼                   │
│          ┌────────────────┐          │
│          │      Risk      │          │
│          │    Response    │          │
│          └───────┬────────┘          │
│                  │                   │
│                  ▼                   │
│          ┌────────────────┐          │
└──────────┤      Risk      │          │
           │   Monitoring   ├──────────┘
           └────────────────┘
```

1. **Risk Identification**
   - Identify assets, threats, and vulnerabilities
   - Document critical services and dependencies

2. **Risk Analysis**
   - Determine likely threat scenarios
   - Evaluate probability and impact
   - Prioritize risks based on severity

3. **Risk Response**
   - Create and implement appropriate measures to reduce exposure
   - Select risk treatment options (accept, mitigate, transfer, avoid)

4. **Risk Monitoring**
   - Continually monitor, review, assess, and evaluate
   - Update risk assessments as conditions change
   - Ensure controls remain effective

## Outcomes of Risk Management

Effective risk management produces:

1. A clear understanding of:
   - The organization's threat, vulnerability, and risk profile
   - Risk exposure
   - Potential consequences of compromise

2. Awareness of risk management priorities based on potential consequences

3. A risk mitigation strategy sufficient to achieve an acceptable level of residual risk

4. Organizational acceptance based on an understanding of potential consequences of residual risk

5. Integration of risk management as "business as usual"
