## Introduction to Incident Response

Incident response involves the organized approach to addressing and managing the aftermath of a security breach or cyberattack. The goal of incident response is to handle the situation in a way that limits damage and reduces recovery time and costs.

Effective incident response is not merely reactive but depends on comprehensive preparation and planning that happens well before an incident occurs.

## Response and Recovery Timeline

Risk management processes identify critical assets, threats, vulnerabilities, and implement security controls to prevent incidents. However, residual risk always remains, making incident response capabilities essential.

The timeline of a security incident follows a progression:

1. **Pre-Incident (Green)**: Planning, operations, prevention, and monitoring activities
2. **Incident (Red)**: The "cold, dark day" when an adverse event occurs requiring immediate response
3. **Recovery (Yellow to Green)**: Progression through contingency recovery, business continuity, and eventual business restoration

Incident response planning addresses how to handle the incident itself and the initial phases of recovery. Business continuity planning addresses the longer-term recovery efforts.

## Key Terminology and Definitions

### Security Operations Centers

**[[_content/dictionary#S|SOC]] (Security Operations Center)**
- Focuses on intrusion prevention and monitoring functions in the security domain
- Serves as the front line for security monitoring and initial incident detection
- May be a physical location with monitoring screens or a virtual capability with automated systems

**[[_content/dictionary#N|NOC]] (Network Operations Center)**
- Monitors the health and function of the network infrastructure
- Focuses on operational performance and availability

**[[_content/dictionary#N|NOSC]] (Network Operations and Security Center)**
- Combines the functions of both [[_content/dictionary#S|SOC]] and [[_content/dictionary#N|NOC]]
- Provides integrated monitoring of both security and operational aspects

### Response Teams

**[[_content/dictionary#C|CSIRT]] (Computer Security Incident Response Team)**
- Responsible for cyber incident response processes
- Activates when a security incident is detected or declared

**[[_content/dictionary#C|CERT]] (Computer Emergency Response Team or Computer Emergency Readiness Team)**
- Often synonymous with [[_content/dictionary#C|CSIRT]]
- May include broader functions such as second and third-tier analysis, research, and coordination
- Often associated with a country, industry sector, or community

**[[_content/dictionary#C|CIRT]] (Computer Incident Response Team)**
- Similar to a [[_content/dictionary#C|CERT]], but typically more company-focused
- Handles specific incident response for an organization

**IRT (Incident Response Team)**
- Functional team found within a [[_content/dictionary#C|CERT]], [[_content/dictionary#S|SOC]], or [[_content/dictionary#N|NOSC]]
- Can also be a standalone team within a company
- For consistency, we will use "[[_content/dictionary#I|IRT]]" throughout this document

## Preparedness Assessment

To determine organizational readiness for security incidents, consider these key questions:

1. **Detection Capabilities**: If you lost control of confidentiality, integrity, or availability to a threat actor, how would you know? What monitoring and control capabilities do you possess?

2. **Contact Procedures**: Who would you call when an incident occurs? Is there a clear escalation path?

3. **Response Actions**: What specific actions would you take during an incident?

4. **Response Personnel**: Who would be dispatched to respond? Are roles and responsibilities clearly defined?

5. **Team Readiness**: Is your response team prepared with appropriate training and exercises?

6. **Resource Availability**: Does your team have all the tools, technology, and authority needed to respond effectively?

These questions should be addressed through comprehensive response and recovery plans.

## Incident Response Lifecycle

According to [[_content/dictionary#N|NIST]] [[_content/dictionary#S|SP]] 800-61, the incident response lifecycle consists of four main phases:

```
┌──────────────┐    ┌──────────────────┐    ┌────────────────────┐    ┌──────────────────┐
│              │    │                  │    │                    │    │                  │
│  Preparation │───►│   Detection &    │───►│    Containment,    │───►│   Post-Incident  │
│              │    │    Analysis      │    │ Eradication, and   │    │     Activity     │
│              │    │                  │    │     Recovery       │    │                  │
└──────────────┘    └──────────────────┘    └────────────────────┘    └──────────────────┘
        ▲                                                                     │
        │                                                                     │
        └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                                 Feedback Loop
```

Ideally, moderate and high-risk information systems should employ automated mechanisms to support the incident handling process. Let's examine each phase in detail:

### Preparation

The preparation phase involves:

- **Alignment**: Ensuring security measures are aligned with business needs and objectives
- **Planning**: Creating a comprehensive incident response plan
- **Procedures**: Developing detailed incident response procedures
- **Prevention**: Implementing controls to prevent incidents from occurring

During preparation, organizations establish the foundation for effective incident response through planning, policy development, and training. This phase is continuous, taking place before an incident occurs.

### Detection and Analysis

The detection and analysis phase focuses on:

- **Identification**: Recognizing precursors (warning signs) and indications that an incident may be occurring
- **Analysis**: Performing initial analysis and validation of suspicious activities
- **Assessment**: Determining the type, extent, and magnitude of the incident
- **Documentation**: Recording all facts regarding the incident and maintaining status records
- **Prioritization**: Establishing the priority level for handling the incident
- **Notification**: Informing appropriate individuals within the organization (and other organizations if required)

Documentation is particularly critical during this phase. Maintaining accurate records supports both the immediate response and subsequent investigation or forensics.

### Containment, Eradication, and Recovery

Once an incident has been detected and analyzed, the response moves to:

- **Containment Strategy**: Selecting an approach to prevent further damage
- **Evidence Handling**: Gathering and preserving evidence (data files, operating systems, network traffic, applications, etc.)
- **Forensics**: Following [[_content/dictionary#N|NIST]] [[_content/dictionary#S|SP]] 800-86, "Guide to Integrating Forensic Techniques into Incident Response"
- **Eradication**: Removing the cause of the incident (e.g., malware, compromised accounts)
- **Recovery**: Restoring systems to normal operation in a secure manner

During this phase, balancing operational needs with security requirements is essential. The goal is to minimize damage while preserving evidence and ensuring that recovery doesn't reintroduce vulnerabilities.

### Post-Incident Activity

After the incident has been resolved, the focus shifts to:

- **Lessons Learned**: Gathering and documenting insights from the incident
- **Evidence Retention**: Following the organization's evidence retention policy
- **Process Improvement**: Incorporating lessons learned into preparation for future incidents

The post-incident phase creates a feedback loop, where lessons learned inform and enhance the preparation phase before the next incident occurs.

## Structure of an Incident Response Team

An effective Incident Response Team requires diverse skills and capabilities:

└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

An effective [[_content/dictionary#I|IRT]] requires integration of multiple capabilities:

- **Core Team**: Full-time detection and analysis personnel
- **Technical Specialists**: Forensics experts, intelligence analysts, network monitoring specialists
- **Support Functions**: Legal counsel, management, policy experts
- **Enablement**: Planning, training, and exercise facilitators

This diverse team structure ensures that all aspects of incident response—from technical analysis to management decision-making—are properly addressed.

## Detailed Breakdown of Response Phases

Each phase of incident response contains multiple sub-steps that must be managed effectively:

└────────────┴─────────────────┴────────────┴───────────┴──────────┴───────────────┘
```

It's important to recognize that these activities occur continuously at different levels:

- **Preparation**: Always ongoing with policy reviews, training, and exercises
- **Detection**: Systems constantly monitor for security events
- **Response**: May be handling multiple incidents at different stages simultaneously

Managing this complexity requires well-defined processes, skilled personnel, and appropriate technological support.

## Anatomy of Effective Incident Response

Each phase of incident response has specific objectives and challenges:

### Preparation
**Objective**: Ensure readiness for incident handling
**Focus**: Training teams, developing procedures, implementing monitoring
**Challenge**: Maintaining readiness without having experienced an incident

### Detection & Analysis
**Objective**: Identify security events that could develop into incidents
**Focus**: Monitoring systems, analyzing alerts, determining severity
**Challenge**: Distinguishing between normal activities and potential threats

### Containment
**Objective**: Stop attacks quickly before extensive damage occurs
**Focus**: Forensics, defensive tactics, isolation of affected systems
**Challenge**: Balancing the need for rapid response with evidence preservation

### Eradication
**Objective**: Remove all traces of the attacker to prevent re-infection
**Focus**: Cleaning systems, removing malware, closing vulnerabilities
**Challenge**: Ensuring complete removal of sophisticated threats

### Recovery
**Objective**: Return systems to normal operation
**Focus**: Restoration of services, verification of security
**Challenge**: Ensuring systems are truly clean before reconnection

### Lessons Learned
**Objective**: Improve future response capabilities
**Focus**: Documentation, process improvements, policy changes
**Challenge**: Capturing insights while they're fresh but after the crisis has passed

Effective incident response requires coordination across all these phases, with documentation throughout the process to support both immediate needs and future improvements.

Time is critical during incident response, but thorough preparation and systematic handling lead to the best outcomes. When incidents are well-managed, they become valuable learning opportunities that strengthen the organization's overall security posture.
