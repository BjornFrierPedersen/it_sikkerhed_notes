## Introduction to Critical Assets & Operations

Understanding what assets and operations are critical to an organization is fundamental to effective risk management. Critical assets and operations are those that, if compromised, would significantly impact the organization's ability to achieve its mission and objectives. This document provides guidance on identifying, categorizing, and evaluating critical assets and operations to support risk assessment and management activities.

A systematic approach to identifying critical assets and operations enables organizations to:
- Focus security resources where they matter most
- Make informed decisions about risk priorities
- Develop targeted protection strategies
- Establish appropriate recovery priorities

## Identifying Critical Assets

Critical assets are the resources an organization depends on to operate successfully. They may be tangible (physical) or intangible and can exist in various forms across the organization.

### Types of Critical Assets

#### Information Assets
- **Data**: Customer information, intellectual property, financial records, employee data
- **Databases**: Customer relationship management systems, enterprise resource planning systems
- **Documentation**: Policies, procedures, business plans, system designs

#### Technology Assets
- **Hardware**: Servers, workstations, mobile devices, network equipment
- **Software**: Operating systems, applications, custom code, utilities
- **Network Infrastructure**: Routers, switches, firewalls, cabling

#### Physical Assets
- **Facilities**: Data centers, office buildings, manufacturing plants
- **Equipment**: Manufacturing equipment, specialized tools, backup generators
- **Environmental Controls**: [[_content/dictionary#H|HVAC]] systems, fire suppression, physical access controls

#### Human Assets
- **Personnel**: Key staff with specialized knowledge or skills
- **Roles**: Positions critical to operational continuity
- **Organizational Knowledge**: Institutional knowledge, operational procedures

### Assessment Methodologies

Several methodologies can help identify critical assets:

#### Business Impact Analysis ([[_content/dictionary#B|BIA]])
A BIA identifies the impact of disruption to business functions and processes. Through this analysis, organizations can:
- Identify critical business functions
- Determine which assets support those functions
- Assess the impact if those assets were compromised or unavailable

#### Criticality Assessment
This involves evaluating assets based on:
- **Mission Criticality**: How essential is the asset to the organization's mission?
- **Replaceability**: How difficult would it be to replace?
- **Dependencies**: What depends on this asset?
- **Regulatory Requirements**: Are there compliance obligations related to the asset?

#### Asset Mapping
Creating a visual representation of assets and their relationships:

```
┌───────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐     ┌──────────────┐
│ Business      │     │ Applications &   │     │ Infrastructure│
│ Functions     │────►│ Information      │────►│ Components   │
└───────────────┘     └─────────────────┘     └──────────────┘
      │                      │                       │
      │                      │                       │
      ▼                      ▼                       ▼
┌───────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐     ┌──────────────┐
│ Business      │     │ Security         │     │ Recovery     │
│ Requirements  │     │ Requirements     │     │ Requirements │
└───────────────┘     └─────────────────┘     └──────────────┘
```

## Critical Operations

Critical operations are the business processes and activities that must continue with minimal disruption to maintain organizational viability.

### Business Processes

Business processes that typically qualify as critical include:
- **Core Production Processes**: Manufacturing, service delivery
- **Revenue Generation**: Sales, order processing, billing
- **Customer Service**: Support, relationship management
- **Supply Chain Management**: Procurement, inventory, logistics
- **Financial Operations**: Payment processing, payroll, financial reporting
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Mandatory reporting, auditing

### Operational Dependencies

Critical operations rarely exist in isolation. Understanding the dependencies between operations is essential:

#### Upstream Dependencies
Resources, inputs, or activities that must be available before a critical operation can function:
- Raw materials
- Data feeds
- Authorization processes

#### Downstream Dependencies
Processes or entities that depend on the output of a critical operation:
- Customers
- Business partners
- Internal departments

#### Horizontal Dependencies
Related processes that operate in parallel and may share resources:
- Shared infrastructure
- Common personnel
- Shared databases

#### External Dependencies
Third-party services or providers critical to operations:
- Cloud service providers
- Internet service providers
- Utilities (power, water)
- Vendors and suppliers

Mapping these dependencies helps identify cascading impacts:

```
┌─────────────┐      ┌─────────────┐      ┌─────────────┐
│ Upstream    │      │ Critical    │      │ Downstream  │
│ Dependencies│─────►│ Operation   │─────►│ Dependencies│
└─────────────┘      └──────┬──────┘      └─────────────┘
                            │
                            │
                     ┌──────▼──────┐
                     │ External    │
                     │ Dependencies│
                     └─────────────┘
```

## Asset Valuation

Valuing critical assets helps organizations prioritize protection efforts and make informed risk management decisions.

### Valuation Methods

#### Replacement Cost
The cost to replace an asset with one of similar capability:
- Purchase price of new equipment
- Development costs for custom software
- Training costs for new personnel

#### Revenue Impact
The financial impact of asset loss or compromise:
- Lost sales
- Service disruption costs
- Contract penalties

#### Competitive Advantage
The strategic value of an asset:
- Intellectual property worth
- Market positioning value
- Reputation value

#### Regulatory Value
The compliance implications of the asset:
- Penalties for non-compliance
- Audit findings costs
- Regulatory shutdown impacts

### Qualitative vs. Quantitative Approaches

#### Qualitative Valuation
Assets are rated on a descriptive scale:

| Value Rating | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Critical** | Essential to organizational survival; irreplaceable in short term |
| **High** | Significant impact on operations; difficult to replace |
| **Medium** | Moderate impact on operations; replaceable with effort |
| **Low** | Minor impact on operations; easily replaceable |

#### Quantitative Valuation
Assets are assigned monetary values:
- Direct costs (replacement, recovery)
- Indirect costs (reputation damage, lost productivity)
- Opportunity costs (missed business opportunities)

#### Mixed Approach
Many organizations use a combination of both approaches:
- Qualitative for initial screening
- Quantitative for high-value assets requiring detailed analysis

## Asset Categorization & Classification

Categorizing assets helps organizations apply appropriate security controls based on asset sensitivity and importance.

### Common Classification Schemas

#### Sensitivity-Based Classification
- **Restricted**: Highly sensitive information requiring strict controls
- **Confidential**: Sensitive information with limited access
- **Internal**: For general organizational use, not for public disclosure
- **Public**: Information that can be freely shared

#### Criticality-Based Classification
- **Mission Critical**: Required for core operations
- **Business Critical**: Important but not immediately essential
- **Operational**: Supports daily operations
- **Administrative**: Supports business functions but not operations

### Classification Matrix

A matrix approach can combine multiple classification dimensions:

```
             │ Low Sensitivity │ Medium Sensitivity │ High Sensitivity │
─────────────┼────────────────┼───────────────────┼──────────────────┤
High         │                │                   │                  │
Criticality  │     Level 2    │      Level 3      │     Level 4      │
─────────────┼────────────────┼───────────────────┼──────────────────┤
Medium       │                │                   │                  │
Criticality  │     Level 1    │      Level 2      │     Level 3      │
─────────────┼────────────────┼───────────────────┼──────────────────┤
Low          │                │                   │                  │
Criticality  │     Level 0    │      Level 1      │     Level 2      │
─────────────┴────────────────┴───────────────────┴──────────────────┘
```

## Critical Infrastructure Considerations

For organizations that operate or support critical infrastructure, additional considerations apply.

### Critical Infrastructure Sectors
According to many national frameworks, critical infrastructure includes:
- Energy (power generation, fuel supply)
- Water systems
- Transportation
- Communications
- Healthcare and public health
- Financial services
- Emergency services
- Information technology
- Government facilities

### Special Requirements for Critical Infrastructure
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Sector-specific regulations
- **National Security Implications**: Potential impacts on national security
