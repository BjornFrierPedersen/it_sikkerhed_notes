## Introduction to Threat Analysis

Threat analysis is a critical component of effective risk management. It helps organizations identify, evaluate, and prioritize potential threats to their operations, assets, and personnel. By understanding what threatens an organization, security professionals can develop appropriate controls and mitigation strategies.

## Threat Analysis Framework

### Business Concerns

A useful starting point for threat analysis is to consider "what keeps you up at night" - the uncertainties and potential dangers that concern decision-makers and stakeholders in the organization. Common business concerns that may lead to operational or existential risk include:

- **External Events**: Power outages, floods, and other natural disasters restricting access to facilities
- **Human Error**: Staff entering incorrect data into company databases
- **Social Engineering**: Company executives becoming victims of spear phishing tactics
- **Physical Security Gaps**: Lack of physical security where staff access critical company resources

These concerns reflect uncertainties about vulnerabilities that could be exploited by various threats, potentially causing significant harm to the organization.

### Critical Assets

When conducting threat analysis, it's essential to identify which critical assets are at risk. Critical assets typically fall into four major categories:

```
┌─────────────────┐   ┌─────────────────┐   ┌─────────────────┐   ┌─────────────────┐
│     [[_content/dictionary#P|PEOPLE]]      │   │   [[_content/dictionary#I|INFORMATION]]   │   │   [[_content/dictionary#T|TECHNOLOGY]]    │   │    [[_content/dictionary#F|FACILITIES]]   │
│                 │   │                 │   │                 │   │                 │
│ • Employees     │   │ • Data          │   │ • Hardware      │   │ • Buildings     │
│ • Contractors   │   │ • Databases     │   │ • Software      │   │ • Infrastructure│
│ • Third-party   │   │ • Records       │   │ • Networks      │   │ • Utilities     │
│   providers     │   │ • Knowledge     │   │ • Systems       │   │ • Off-site      │
│                 │   │                 │   │                 │   │   locations     │
└─────────────────┘   └─────────────────┘   └─────────────────┘   └─────────────────┘
```

When assessing these assets, consider:

- **People**: Includes employees with specialized skills or knowledge that would be difficult to replace
- **Information**: Encompasses data and knowledge assets, including those held by vendors and third-party providers
- **Technology**: Hardware, software, and network infrastructure, including technologies used by vendors
- **Facilities**: Physical locations and infrastructure, including off-site storage (e.g., cloud facilities)

For all categories, it's important to consider third-party dependencies, where external organizations provide elements critical to your operations.

### Vulnerabilities and Outcomes

Vulnerabilities are weaknesses that can be exploited by threats. They generally fall into three categories:

1. **Technical Vulnerabilities**: Weaknesses in physical or virtual systems
   - Examples: Unpatched software, outdated hardware, insecure network configurations

2. **Design Vulnerabilities**: Absence of security in the asset's design
   - Examples: Systems built without security requirements, lack of encryption, single points of failure

3. **Procedural Vulnerabilities**: Weaknesses in processes and human behaviors
   - Examples: Inadequate training, poorly written procedures, lack of compliance verification

When a vulnerability is exploited by a threat, it can lead to various negative outcomes for assets, typically categorized in terms of information security principles:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                      [[_content/dictionary#P|POTENTIAL]] [[_content/dictionary#O|OUTCOMES]]                           │
├────────────────┬────────────────────┬────────────────────────────┤
│   [[_content/dictionary#D|DISCLOSURE]]   │      [[_content/dictionary#M|MODIFY]]        │      [[_content/dictionary#L|LOSE]]/[[_content/dictionary#I|INTERRUPT]]        │
│                │                    │                            │
│  Violation of  │    Violation of    │      Violation of          │
│ Confidentiality│     Integrity      │      Availability          │
└────────────────┴────────────────────┴────────────────────────────┘
```

- **Disclosure**: When protected information is revealed to unauthorized parties (violating confidentiality)
- **Modification**: When information or assets are altered inappropriately (violating integrity)
- **Loss**: When information or assets cannot be recovered (violating both confidentiality and availability)
- **Interruption**: When access to information or assets is temporarily prevented (violating availability)

## Understanding Threats

### Threat Definition

A threat can be defined as:
- An event that causes a risk to materialize into a loss
- Any potential danger that exploits a vulnerability

Threats are particularly important to understand because they often involve actors with specific motivations and capabilities to exploit vulnerabilities in your organization.

### Threat Components

A comprehensive understanding of threats involves analyzing multiple components:

```
┌──────────────────────┐
│   Critical Asset,    │
│ Operation, or Service│
└──────────┬───────────┘
           │
           ▼
┌──────────────────────┐
│        [[_content/dictionary#T|THREAT]]        │
├────────────┬─────────┤
│  [[_content/dictionary#A|ACTORS]]    │ [[_content/dictionary#A|ACTIONS]] │
├────────────┼─────────┤
│• Insiders  │• [[_content/dictionary#D|DOS]]    │
│• Natural   │• [[_content/dictionary#D|DDOS]]   │
│  disasters │• Corrupt│
│• Criminals │• Intrude│
│            │• Fire   │
└────────────┴─────────┘
           │
           ▼
┌──────────┴───────────┐
│   Actor Motivation   │
│        Effect        │
└──────────────────────┘
```

The key components include:

1. **Actors**: Who or what might exploit a vulnerability
   - Insiders (employees, contractors)
   - Natural disasters
   - Criminals
   - Nation-state actors
   - Hacktivists

2. **Actions**: How the threat might manifest
   - Denial of service attacks
   - Data corruption
   - Network intrusions
   - Physical damage (e.g., fire)
   - Theft

3. **Motivations**: Why the threat actor is targeting the organization
   - Financial gain
   - Political ideology
   - Competitive advantage
   - Revenge
   - Accidental (no motivation)

4. **Effects**: The intended outcome of the threat action
   - Business disruption
   - Information theft
   - Reputational damage
   - Financial loss

## Categories of Threats

### Natural vs. Human-Made Threats

Threats can be broadly categorized as follows:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                       [[_content/dictionary#T|THREATS]]                             │
├────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────────┤
│   [[_content/dictionary#N|NATURAL]]/[[_content/dictionary#E|ENVIRONMENT]]  │           [[_content/dictionary#H|HUMAN]]-[[_content/dictionary#M|MADE]]            │
│                        │                                 │
│  • Floods              ├─────────────┬─────────────────┐ │
│  • Earthquakes         │ [[_content/dictionary#D|DELIBERATE]]  │   [[_content/dictionary#A|ACCIDENTAL]]    │ │
│  • Hurricanes          │             │                 │ │
│  • Fires               │ • Malicious │ • User errors   │ │
│  • Disease outbreaks   │   insiders  │ • Misconfigured │ │
│                        │ • Hackers   │   systems       │ │
│                        │ • Terrorists│ • Poor processes│ │
└────────────────────────┴─────────────┴─────────────────┘ │
                                                            │
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
│               [[_content/dictionary#U|USER]] [[_content/dictionary#A|ACCESS]] [[_content/dictionary#S|SPECTRUM]]
│
│  [[_content/dictionary#U|UNAUTHORIZED]] <────────────────────────> [[_content/dictionary#A|AUTHORIZED]]
│  Low Access                               High Access
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

1. **Natural/Environmental Threats**: Events not directly caused by human action
   - Typically addressed through insurance and business continuity planning

2. **Human-Made Threats**: Caused by human action, either deliberate or accidental
   - **Deliberate**: Intentional actions to cause harm
   - **Accidental**: Unintended actions or errors that cause harm

When considering human threats, it's important to assess the user access spectrum:
- Unauthorized users with low access attempting to gain greater access
- Authorized users with high access potentially misusing their privileges

### Beyond Cyber Threats

While cybersecurity threats often receive the most attention, organizations face a much broader threat landscape:

1. **Natural Disasters**
   - Typhoons, tornadoes, floods, earthquakes, tsunamis, fires

2. **Deliberate Destruction**
   - Terrorism, sabotage, war, theft, fraud, arson, labor disputes

3. **Loss of Utilities or Services**
   - Power, gas, water, oil and petrochemical, communications

4. **Equipment Failure**
   - Internal power, [[_content/dictionary#H|HVAC]], security systems, control systems

5. **Information Security**
   - Malware, cybercrime, [[_content/dictionary#I|IT]] system failure, system misconfiguration, unpatched systems

6. **Other**
   - Epidemics, contamination, workplace violence, political events (nationalization)

7. **Non-emergency**
   - Health, safety, morale issues, mergers, negative publicity, legal challenges

These threat categories are often interconnected. For example, a hurricane (natural disaster) may lead to power loss (utility failure), which then causes equipment failure and creates opportunities for physical theft or cyber intrusions during the recovery period.

## Case Study: Defense Scenario

Consider a naval battlegroup deployment scenario, where commanders must consider a broad threat landscape:

### Kinetic Threats
- Adverse forces seeking armed conflict
- Shipping traffic and collision risks
- Severe weather events
- Navigation hazards (shallow waters, reefs)

### Cyber-related Threats
- [[_content/dictionary#I|IT]] system failures
- Equipment malfunctions
- Malware infections
- Sabotage of control systems

### Other Threats
- Adverse or ignorant insiders
- Low morale affecting performance
- Communication failures

This scenario illustrates how threats can be interconnected. For example, low morale could lead to a disgruntled sailor becoming an insider threat, potentially compromising systems or sharing sensitive information with adversaries. Similarly, severe weather could affect both communications and navigation systems, creating cascading vulnerabilities.

Effective threat analysis requires considering these interdependencies and developing holistic strategies that address multiple threat vectors simultaneously.
