## Introduction to Disaster Recovery

Disaster recovery is a critical component of an organization's risk management strategy. It focuses on how business operations will be restored following a disaster or major disruption. While business continuity planning addresses the overall ability of an organization to continue functioning during and after a disaster, disaster recovery specifically deals with restoring [[_content/dictionary#I|IT]] infrastructure and operations to their normal state.

Effective disaster recovery planning requires careful consideration of both technical and non-technical factors, and must be tailored to the specific needs and resources of the organization.

## Disaster Recovery Plan ([[_content/dictionary#D|DRP]])

A Disaster Recovery Plan ([[_content/dictionary#D|DRP]]) details how business operations will be restored after a disaster. It provides specific procedures, responsibilities, and timelines for recovery activities.

Key elements of a Disaster Recovery Plan include:

- Recovery procedures for critical systems and infrastructure
- Roles and responsibilities during recovery operations
- Communication procedures and contact information
- Resource requirements and logistics
- Testing and maintenance procedures

Organizations may implement various arrangements to support their disaster recovery strategies, including:

- **Mutual Aid Agreements**: Arrangements between organizations to provide assistance during disasters
- **Subscription Services**: Contracted services that provide recovery facilities or resources
- **Multiple Processing Centers**: Distributed operations that provide redundancy

The specific components of a [[_content/dictionary#D|DRP]] will depend on the organization's size, industry, regulatory requirements, and risk profile.

## Contingency Planning

Even the best disaster recovery plans may fail under certain circumstances. Organizations should develop contingency plans to address scenarios where primary recovery strategies are ineffective or unavailable.

### Backup Contingency Plans

A backup contingency plan provides an alternate solution should the primary disaster recovery plan fail. This represents a "Plan B" that can be implemented if the initial recovery strategy encounters obstacles or proves inadequate.

Backup plans should:
- Be documented and accessible
- Receive appropriate levels of testing
- Have clear activation criteria
- Address alternative recovery paths

### Backout Contingency Plans

A backout contingency plan defines procedures for backing out of preparations, contracts, or agreements when necessary. This might involve:

- Reversing changes made during recovery attempts
- Terminating temporary service agreements
- Switching to alternative recovery strategies

Backout plans should be the product of detailed risk analysis and should include consideration of:
- Legal implications of backing out of agreements
- Financial consequences of changing direction
- Operational impacts of abandoning initial recovery efforts

These decisions are typically significant business decisions that may require legal counsel to fully understand the contractual and financial implications.

## Non-Technical Recovery Considerations

While much of disaster recovery focuses on technical systems, successful recovery depends heavily on non-technical factors that must be addressed in planning.

### People and Personnel

The most critical resource in any recovery effort is your people. When planning for disaster recovery:

- **Recognize personal priorities**: During a disaster, people will prioritize their families and personal safety over work responsibilities
- **Support personal preparedness**: Help employees prepare their families for emergencies so they can return to work sooner
- **Develop financial support mechanisms**: Consider pre-loaded emergency credit cards or cash advances to help employees manage immediate post-disaster expenses
- **Establish clear expectations**: Define when and how employees should report for recovery duties
- **Plan for stress management**: Provide support resources for employees dealing with disaster-related stress

### Utilities and Infrastructure

Recovery operations require basic infrastructure to function:

- **Power**: Ensure backup power generation with adequate fuel supplies and resupply arrangements
- **Water**: Consider water requirements for both personnel and equipment (e.g., cooling systems)
- **[[_content/dictionary#H|HVAC]]**: Many technical systems require climate control to operate properly
- **Communications**: Establish redundant communication methods (landlines, cell phones, satellite phones, radio)
- **Diversity**: Avoid single points of failure by using multiple providers and technologies

For example, with backup generators, it's essential to plan not just for initial operation but for ongoing fuel supply, especially during widespread disasters when fuel may be difficult to obtain.

### Logistics

Detailed logistics planning addresses the practical aspects of implementing recovery:

- **Activation procedures**: Who declares a disaster and initiates recovery operations
- **Team activation**: How recovery team members are notified and mobilized
- **Alternative communications**: Backup communication methods if primary channels fail
- **Transportation**: How personnel and equipment will reach alternate recovery sites
- **Site access**: Addressing access control and security at recovery locations
- **Supply chain**: How equipment, supplies, and other necessities will be obtained

Recovery logistics often face challenges during widespread disasters when normal transportation and supply chains are disrupted.

### Agreements and Contracts

Formal agreements establish the foundation for external recovery support:

- **Service Agreements**: Contracts between the organization and vendors addressing recovery needs
  - Ensure exclusivity or priority access during regional disasters
  - Verify that providers have sufficient capacity to support multiple clients during widespread events

- **Mutual Support Agreements**: Arrangements between similar but non-competitive organizations
  - Address confidentiality and intellectual property protection
  - Clearly define space allocations, resource access, and duration
  - Establish billing and cost-sharing arrangements

All agreements should:
- Clearly detail expectations and responsibilities
- Be regularly reviewed and updated
- Be tested through joint exercises
- Address termination conditions and procedures

## Data Backup Strategies

Effective data backup is foundational to successful disaster recovery. Backups provide copies of original information assets that are critical to recovery operations.

### Backup Types

Organizations typically implement one or more of these backup approaches:

#### Full Backup
- Backs up everything in the defined scope
- Clears the archive attribute on files
- Typically performed weekly or when major system changes occur
- Characteristics:
  - **Advantages**: Fastest restoration, all data in one location
  - **Disadvantages**: Takes longest to perform, requires the most storage space

#### Incremental Backup
- Backs up everything that has changed since the last backup (files with archive attribute set)
- Resets the archive attribute after backup
- Characteristics:
  - **Advantages**: Fast backup process, requires the least storage space
  - **Disadvantages**: Requires the longest time to restore, needs all incremental backups since last full backup

#### Differential Backup
- Backs up everything that has changed since the last full backup (files with archive attribute set)
- Does [[_content/dictionary#N|NOT]] reset the archive attribute
- Characteristics:
  - **Advantages**: Faster restoration than incremental, only requires full backup plus latest differential
  - **Disadvantages**: Slower backup than incremental, requires more storage space than incremental

### Backup Considerations

When implementing backup systems, consider these key factors:

- **Comprehensive coverage**:
  - Back up all critical components: data, source code, license keys, configurations
  - Include router and network equipment configurations
  - Don't forget physical documentation and paper records

- **Data prioritization**:
  - Tier data based on importance and required recovery speed
  - Apply appropriate backup frequency to each tier
  - Consider different strategies for different data types (e.g., file server vs. email)

- **Location**:
  - Balance between on-site (fast recovery) and off-site (disaster protection) backups
  - Ensure geographical diversity for off-site storage
  - Consider multiple independent connections to backup facilities

- **Security**:
  - Encrypt backups, especially those stored off-site
  - Implement strong access controls to backup systems
  - Protect backup metadata and catalogs

- **Testing**:
  - Regularly test restoration processes
  - Verify data integrity after restoration
  - Practice recovery in realistic scenarios

- **Documentation**:
  - Document backup schedules and retention policies
  - Maintain detailed restoration procedures
  - Keep backup system configurations current

Remember that untested backups may provide a false sense of security. Regular restoration testing is essential to verify that backups are usable when needed.

## System Redundancy and Availability

Beyond data backups, organizations can implement various forms of system redundancy to increase availability and reduce recovery time.

### Redundancy Concepts

Redundancy provides duplicate components or systems that can take over if primary systems fail. Common redundancy approaches include:

- **Direct Attached Storage ([[_content/dictionary#D|DAS]])**: Provides local storage redundancy
- **Network Attached Storage ([[_content/dictionary#N|NAS]])**: Offers shared storage with built-in redundancy features
- **Storage Area Networks ([[_content/dictionary#S|SAN]])**: Provides high-performance, highly available storage
- **[[_content/dictionary#R|RAID]] (Redundant Array of Independent Disks)**: Various configurations that protect against disk failures

### Fault Tolerance

Fault tolerance allows systems to continue normal operation despite hardware or software failures. Fault-tolerant systems include:

- **Clustered servers**: Multiple servers operating as a single system
- **Load-balanced systems**: Distributing workloads across multiple systems
- **Redundant components**: Duplicate power supplies, network cards, or other components
- **Failover systems**: Standby systems that activate when primary systems fail

### High Availability

High availability focuses on maximizing system uptime through:

- **Identifying critical assets and failure vulnerabilities**
- **Implementing appropriate fault tolerance solutions**:
  - [[_content/dictionary#R|RAID]] configurations
  - Redundant services and infrastructure
  - Uninterruptible power supplies ([[_content/dictionary#U|UPS]])
  - Hot-swappable components
- **Creating mirrored functionalities** at alternate sites
- **Developing rapid recovery procedures**

The appropriate level of redundancy and availability depends on:
- Recovery time objectives
- Budget constraints
- Technical capabilities
- Criticality of systems

## Alternate Processing Sites

When primary facilities are unavailable, organizations may need alternate sites to continue operations. Several types of alternate sites offer different levels of readiness and cost.

### Multiple Processing Centers

Multiple processing centers provide geographically separated facilities that are in continuous use:

- Operations are distributed across multiple locations under normal conditions
- When one center is disrupted, workload shifts to the remaining centers
- No downtime occurs, but remaining centers must handle increased load
- Requires advanced load balancing and distributed processing capabilities
- Typically the most expensive approach but offers maximum availability

### Mirrored Sites

A mirrored site is an exact functioning copy of the primary site:

- Contains duplicate systems, software, and data
- Systems and data are kept current, often through real-time replication
- Provides immediate availability with no downtime
- Very high costs due to duplicate infrastructure and maintenance
- Offers the fastest recovery time of any alternate site approach

### Hot Sites

A hot site is a fully equipped facility ready for rapid activation:

- Contains hardware, software, and network configurations similar to the primary site
- May require restoration of recent data backups
- Typically operational within 4 hours
- Less expensive than mirrored sites but still significant investment
- Often operated by specialized service providers on a subscription basis

### Warm Sites

A warm site is a partially equipped facility that requires additional setup time:

- Contains some equipment and infrastructure but not fully configured
- Requires installation of additional equipment and restoration of backups
- Typically requires a few days to become operational
- Moderate cost compared to hot sites
- Good balance between cost and recovery time for many organizations

### Cold Sites

A cold site is essentially an empty shell facility:

- Provides basic infrastructure (space, power, environmental controls)
- Contains no equipment or configurations
- Requires complete equipment installation and configuration
- Longest setup time and downtime of all alternate site options
- Lowest cost option but also highest business impact during recovery

### Mobile Units

Mobile units provide portable recovery facilities:

- Typically contracted services that deliver trailers or containers
- Can be delivered to locations near the primary site
- Contain basic infrastructure and sometimes equipment
- Usually requires extensive time to become operational
- Provides flexibility in recovery location
- May be suitable for organizations with specialized equipment needs

## Recovery Metrics

Several metrics help organizations quantify and plan for recovery operations.

### Mean Time to Repair ([[_content/dictionary#M|MTTR]])

Mean Time to Repair or Restore represents the average time required to fix a failed component or system:

- Measures how quickly repairs can be completed
- Helps prioritize recovery efforts
- May vary based on the nature of the failure and available resources
- Can be reduced through improved documentation, spare parts, and trained personnel

### Mean Time Between Failures ([[_content/dictionary#M|MTBF]])

Mean Time Between Failures represents the expected lifetime of a device in a specific operating environment:

- Indicates the reliability of components or systems
- Helps predict when failures might occur
- Guides maintenance schedules and replacement strategies
- Typically provided by manufacturers based on testing

### Recovery Time Objective ([[_content/dictionary#R|RTO]])

Recovery Time Objective defines the maximum acceptable time to restore a business function after a disaster:

- Sets clear expectations for recovery performance
- Guides selection of recovery strategies and technologies
- May vary for different systems based on criticality
- Should be defined as part of business impact analysis

### Recovery Point Objective ([[_content/dictionary#R|RPO]])

Recovery Point Objective defines how much data loss is acceptable:

- Measured as the point in time to which data must be recovered
- Determines backup frequency and synchronization requirements
- Balances cost against acceptable data loss
- Often expressed in minutes, hours, or days

### Maximum Tolerable Downtime ([[_content/dictionary#M|MTD]])

Maximum Tolerable Downtime (also called Maximum Tolerable Period of Disruption) represents the maximum time a business function can be inoperable before causing significant harm:

- Sets the absolute limit for recovery timing
- [[_content/dictionary#R|RTO]] must be less than [[_content/dictionary#M|MTD]] to provide recovery margin
- Typically defined by business leaders based on operational impacts
- May be influenced by regulatory or contractual requirements

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

A good rule of thumb is that [[_content/dictionary#R|RTO]] should be less than half of [[_content/dictionary#M|MTD]] to provide adequate margin for unexpected complications during recovery.

## Recovery Strategies

Recovery strategies define the approach an organization will take to restore operations after a disaster.

### Selecting Recovery Strategies

Recovery strategies should be:

- Derived from the business impact analysis
- Designed to address identified risks
- Aligned with recovery time objectives
- Cost-effective relative to the risks they address
- Appropriate for the organization's capabilities and resources

When selecting strategies, consider:
- The criticality of affected business functions
- Available resources (financial, technical, personnel)
- Organizational risk tolerance
- Regulatory and contractual obligations

### Cost Considerations

Cost is a key factor in recovery strategy selection:

```

- Generally, faster recovery times require higher investment
- Balance the cost of recovery solutions against the cost of downtime
- Avoid "building a $10,000 fence around a stack of quarters"
- Consider both implementation costs and ongoing maintenance costs
- Different systems may warrant different levels of investment based on criticality

### Recovery Strategy Options

Organizations can implement various recovery strategies based on their needs and resources:

#### Surviving Site Redundancy
- Maintain multiple sites performing the same functions
- Allows operations to continue at surviving sites if one is compromised
- Requires standardization across sites and capacity planning

#### Self-Service Recovery
- Organization transfers business to another of its branches or divisions
- Works well for organizations with distributed, similar operations
- Requires standardized systems and processes across locations

#### Internal Arrangement
- Staff and equipment added to another branch's site temporarily
- Uses existing organizational facilities
- May require adjustments to accommodate additional personnel and functions

#### Reciprocal Arrangement
- Agreement with another organization to share facilities during disasters
- Cost-effective but requires careful planning for security and privacy
- Works best with non-competitive organizations with compatible needs

#### Dedicated Alternate Sites
- Purpose-built or contracted facilities for recovery operations
- Options include hot, warm, or cold sites as described earlier
- Provides dedicated resources but at higher cost
- Can be supplemented with work-from-home capabilities

#### Work From Home
- Enables employees to continue operations from home offices
- Requires appropriate equipment, connectivity, and security
- Works best for knowledge workers and digital operations
- May be limited by employees' home situations during widespread disasters

#### External Suppliers
- Professional alternate site providers and recovery services
- Often subscription-based with various service levels
- Provides expertise but may have limitations during regional disasters

The optimal strategy often involves a combination of these approaches, tailored to the specific needs and risks of the organization.
