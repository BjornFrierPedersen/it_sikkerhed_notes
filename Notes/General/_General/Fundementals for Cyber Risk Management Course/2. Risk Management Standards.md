## National Institute of Standards and Technology Special Publications

The National Institute of Standards and Technology ([[_content/dictionary#N|NIST]]) has developed several key publications that provide guidance on risk management. These standards offer a foundation for implementing effective risk management programs in organizations. This document provides an overview of the most important NIST publications related to risk management.

## [[_content/dictionary#N|NIST]] [[_content/dictionary#S|SP]] 800-30: Risk Management Guide for Information Technology Systems

[[_content/dictionary#N|NIST]] [[_content/dictionary#S|SP]] 800-30 provides a foundation for developing an effective risk management program for information technology systems. It contains:

- Definitions and practical guidance for assessing and mitigating risks
- Information on selecting cost-effective security controls
- A structured approach to managing information security risks

### Risk Management Process Overview

At a high level, risk management encompasses three primary processes:

1. **Risk Assessment**: Identifying and evaluating risks to the system
2. **Risk Mitigation**: Implementing controls to reduce risk
3. **Evaluation and Assessment**: Monitoring the effectiveness of controls and reassessing risks

### Risk Assessment Steps

The risk assessment process consists of nine key steps:

#### 1. System Characterization

**Input**:
- Hardware
- Software
- System interfaces
- Data and information
- People
- System mission

**Output**:
- System boundary
- System functions
- System and data criticality
- System and data sensitivity

System characterization involves identifying the scope of the risk management effort, including all relevant components, connections, data, and organizational contexts. It helps establish clear boundaries for the assessment and determine what assets need protection.

#### 2. Threat Identification

**Input**:
- History of system attack
- Data from intelligence agencies, mass media, or government [[_content/dictionary#C|CERT]]

**Output**:
- Threat statement

Threat identification involves researching potential threat sources and creating a comprehensive threat statement. This includes understanding what actors might want from the system and their motivations (e.g., disrupting operations, stealing information).

#### 3. Vulnerability Identification

**Input**:
- Reports from prior risk assessments
- Prior audits
- Security requirements
- Security test results

**Output**:
- List of potential vulnerabilities

This step involves identifying gaps in the system that could be exploited by threat actors. Existing documentation, testing results, and audits provide valuable input for identifying these vulnerabilities.

#### 4. Control Analysis

**Input**:
- Current controls
- Planned controls

**Output**:
- List of current and planned controls

Control analysis examines existing security measures and those planned for implementation. This provides a baseline for understanding how risks are currently being managed and what additional measures might be needed.

#### 5. Likelihood Determination

**Input**:
- Threat-source motivation
- Threat capacity
- Nature of vulnerability
- Current controls

**Output**:
- Likelihood rating

This step involves determining the probability that a vulnerability will be exploited by a threat source. Likelihood ratings can be expressed qualitatively or quantitatively.

##### Likelihood Rating Qualitative Ratings:

- **High**: The threat-source is highly motivated and sufficiently capable, and controls to prevent the vulnerability from being exercised are ineffective.
- **Medium**: The threat-source is motivated and capable, but controls are in place that may impede successful exercise of the vulnerability.
- **Low**: The threat-source lacks motivation or capability, or controls are in place to prevent, or at least significantly impede, the vulnerability from being exercised.

##### Alternative Approach: Quantitative and Functional Risk Appetite Statement

Likelihood can also be characterized in terms of probability percentages and organizational response levels:

| Level | Likelihood - Probability of Risk Occurring |
|-------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Executive Attention** | Risk is between 75-99% likely to occur. Alternatively, this risk has come to fruition within the industry within the past year. |
| **Management Attention** | Risk is between 30-74% likely to occur. Alternatively, this risk has come to fruition within the industry within the past two years. |
| **Front Line Attention** | Risk is between 1-29% likely to occur. Alternatively, the risk has come to fruition within the industry within the past 5 years. |

#### 6. Impact Analysis

**Input**:
- Mission impact analysis
- Asset criticality assessment
- Data criticality
- Data sensitivity

**Output**:
- Impact rating

Impact analysis determines the adverse effects that would occur if a vulnerability is exploited. This includes evaluating how the organization's mission, assets, and data would be affected.

##### Impact Rating Qualitative Ratings:

- **High**:
  - May result in high costly loss of major tangible assets or resources
  - May significantly violate, harm, or impede an organization's mission, reputation, or interest
  - May result in human death or serious injury

- **Medium**:
  - May result in costly loss of tangible assets or resources
  - May violate, harm, or impede an organization's mission, reputation, or interest
  - May result in human injury

- **Low**:
  - May result in loss of some tangible assets or resources
  - May noticeably affect an organization's mission, reputation, or interest

##### Alternative Approach: Quantitative and Functional Risk Appetite Statement

Impact can also be characterized across various organizational factors:

| Impact Level | Revenue (Operating Profit) | Safety | Operations | Reputation | Compliance | Human Capital | Projects |
|--------------|----------------------------|--------|------------|------------|------------|---------------|----------|
| **Executive Attention** | >10% deviation from planned operating profit (quarterly) | Loss of life or permanent disability | >3 days lost operations | Loss of market segment with multiple customers | Debarment from market segment due to regulatory violations | >5% high performer attrition (quarterly) | Liquidated damages exceeding contract value |
| **Management Attention** | >5% deviation from planned operating profit (quarterly) | Time away or reportable incident | Up to 1 day lost operation | Loss of customer | Fines or penalties from regulatory violations | >3% high performer attrition (quarterly) | Liquidated damages eroding profit margin |
| **Front Line Attention** | Any deviation from planned operating profit (quarterly) | Bumps, strains, bruises | Up to 1 shift lost operation | Customer complaints or negative social media | Warnings related to regulatory violations | Developing trend in high performer attrition | Minor disputes with limited contractual impact |

#### 7. Risk Determination

**Input**:
- Likelihood of threat exploitation
- Magnitude of impact
- Adequacy of planned or current controls

**Output**:
- Risks and risk levels

Risk determination involves calculating the level of risk by considering both likelihood and impact ratings. This provides a basis for prioritizing risks and determining appropriate responses.

The final determination of risk is derived by multiplying the ratings assigned for threat likelihood (probability) and threat impact.

#### 8. Control Recommendations

When recommending control solutions to minimize identified risks, consider the following factors:
- Effectiveness of options
- Legal/regulatory requirements
- Organizational policy
- Impact to operations
- Safety/reliability

Control strategies can include:
- **Acceptance**: Documenting and accepting the risk as-is
- **Avoidance**: Eliminating the risk by ceasing the associated activity
- **Transfer**: Sharing the risk with another entity (e.g., through insurance)
- **Mitigation**: Implementing controls to reduce likelihood or impact

#### 9. Results Documentation

Risk assessment reports may include:
- Threat-sources
- Vulnerabilities identified
- Risks assessed
- Recommended controls provided

Thorough documentation ensures that findings are captured for future reference and that assumptions, methodologies, and decisions are transparent.

### Risk Mitigation Steps

Risk mitigation involves implementing controls to reduce identified risks. This process involves several steps:

#### Step 1: Prioritize Actions

Based on risk levels presented in the risk assessment report, implementation actions are prioritized. Top priority should be given to risks with the highest levels.

#### Step 2: Evaluate Recommended Control Options

Analyze the feasibility (e.g., compatibility, user acceptance) and effectiveness (e.g., degree of protection and level of risk mitigation) of the recommended control options. The objective is to select the most appropriate control option for minimizing risk.

#### Step 3: Conduct Cost-Benefit Analysis

If the cost of controls exceeds the benefit, the organization may choose to accept the risk instead. This usually involves a trade-off between security and business operations.

#### Step 4: Select Controls

On the basis of the results of the cost-benefit analysis, management determines the most cost-effective control(s) for reducing risk to the organization's mission.

#### Step 5: Assign Responsibility

Appropriate persons (in-house personnel or external contracting staff) who have the appropriate expertise and skill-sets to implement the selected controls are identified and responsibility is assigned.

#### Step 6: Develop a Safeguard Implementation Plan

The plan should, at a minimum, contain the following information:
- Risks (vulnerability/threat pairs) and associated risk levels (output from risk assessment report)
- Recommended controls (output from risk assessment report)
- Prioritized actions (with priority given to Very High and High risk)
- Selected planned controls (determined on the basis of feasibility, effectiveness, benefits to the organization, and cost)
- Required resources for implementing the selected planned controls
- Lists of responsible teams and staff
- Start date for implementation
- Target completion date for implementation
- Maintenance requirements

#### Step 7: Implement Selected Control(s)

Execute the implementation plan, ensuring that all controls are properly deployed and integrated into the organization's operations.

### Evaluation and Assessment

As business operations or technologies change, periodic reviews must be conducted to:
- Analyze changes
- Account for new threats and vulnerabilities created by changes
- Determine effectiveness of existing controls

Continuous evaluation and assessment of risks is an important component of the risk management life cycle. The result/status needs to be documented and reported to senior management.

## [[_content/dictionary#N|NIST]] [[_content/dictionary#S|SP]] 800-39: Managing Risk from Information Systems

- A structured yet flexible approach for managing risk
- A flagship document in the series of [[_content/dictionary#F|FISMA]]-related publications
- Comprehensive guidance on integrating risk management across the organization

### Tiers of Risk Management

Risk management can be viewed as a holistic activity fully integrated into every aspect of the organization across three tiers:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Tier 1: Organization (Governance)           │
│ Strategic Risk - Long-term planning         │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Tier 2: Mission (Business Process)          │
│ Operational Risk - Business functions       │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Tier 3: Information System                  │
│ Tactical Risk - Day-to-day implementation   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### Tier 1: Organization (Governance)
- Multi-tier Organization-Wide Risk Management
- Implemented by the Risk Executive Function
- Tightly coupled to Enterprise Architecture and Information Security Architecture
- Focuses on strategic risks with long-term implications

- Flexible and Agile Implementation
- Addresses tactical risks at the system level

### Risk Management Process

The risk management process in [[_content/dictionary#N|NIST]] [[_content/dictionary#S|SP]] 800-39 involves a continuous cycle of activities:

```
           ┌────────────────┐
           │   Frame Risk   │
           └───────┬────────┘
                   │
                   ▼
┌──────────────────────────────┐
│                              │
│  ┌─────────┐      ┌────────┐ │
│  │ Assess  │      │Monitor │ │
│  │  Risk   │◄─────┤  Risk  │ │
│  └────┬────┘      └────┬───┘ │
│       │                │     │
│       ▼                ▲     │
│  ┌─────────┐           │     │
│  │Respond  ├───────────┘     │
│  │to Risk  │                 │
│  └─────────┘                 │
│                              │
└──────────────────────────────┘
```

The process includes:
1. **Frame Risk**: Establish the context for risk decisions
2. **Assess Risk**: Identify threats, vulnerabilities, likelihood, and impact
3. **Respond to Risk**: Develop and implement risk response strategies
4. **Monitor Risk**: Track effectiveness of risk responses and changes to risk factors

### Risk Framing

Risk framing establishes the context and provides a common perspective on how organizations manage risk. It produces a risk management strategy that addresses how organizations intend to:
- Assess risk
- Respond to risk
- Monitor risk

The risk management strategy makes explicit the specific assumptions, constraints, risk tolerances, and priorities/trade-offs used within organizations for making investment and operational decisions.

### Risk Monitoring

Risk monitoring provides organizations with the means to:
- Verify compliance
- Determine the ongoing effectiveness of risk response measures
- Identify risk-impacting changes to organizational information systems and environments of operation

Analyzing monitoring results provides organizations the capability to:
- Maintain awareness of the risk being incurred
- Highlight the need to revisit other steps in the risk management process
- Initiate process improvement activities as needed

### Risk Response

Risk response is triggered when:
- Organizations experience a breach/compromise to their information systems or environments of operation requiring an immediate response to address the incident and reduce additional risk resulting from the event
- The organization is required to deploy new safeguards and countermeasures in their information systems based on security requirements in new legislation or policies

The risk response step:
- Can receive inputs from the risk framing step
- Shapes the resource constraints associated with selecting an appropriate course of action
- Can receive inputs from the risk monitoring step

## [[_content/dictionary#N|NIST]] [[_content/dictionary#S|SP]] 800-37: Risk Management Framework

[[_content/dictionary#N|NIST]] [[_content/dictionary#S|SP]] 800-37 provides a Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems, with a security life cycle approach. These guidelines ensure that:
- Managing information system security risks is consistent with the organization's objectives and overall risk strategy
- Information security requirements are integrated into the organization's enterprise architecture and System Development Life Cycle ([[_content/dictionary#S|SDLC]])

### The Risk Management Framework ([[_content/dictionary#R|RMF]])

The [[_content/dictionary#R|RMF]] consists of the following steps:

```
┌─────────────┐
│   Prepare   │
└──────┬──────┘
       │
       ▼
┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
│ Categorize  │────►│   Select    │────►│  Implement  │
└──────┬──────┘     └──────┬──────┘     └──────┬──────┘
       │                   │                   │
       │                   │                   │
       │                   │                   ▼
